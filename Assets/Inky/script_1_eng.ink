- I have moved into this region wanting peace and quiet. But on arriving I discovered that the water has a faint taste of mud.
 Instead of being PASSIVE about it, I was <anim=SlowSine>PROACTIVE</anim>.
 I studied the <anim=SlowSine>LAYOUT</anim> of the <anim=SlowSine>REGIÃ“N</anim> and built my own <anim=SlowSine>PLUMBING</anim>.
 (The plumbing was hard. Did you know that tubes can only follow straight lines? I didn't)
- Now I have access to the <anim=LightPos>PUREST WATER</anim>!!!
 What? You know someone who's sick? Well, I feel for you...
 The packages aren't ready yet! Come back after two weeks.
